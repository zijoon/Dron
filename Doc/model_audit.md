# Model Audit - UTDRP-DP

This file records a faithful implementation mapping for the unpaired truck-drone routing model used in this codebase.
The implementation follows this structure:
- Truck-and-drone routing decision variables on arc sets.
- Exact customer assignment with single-service constraints.
- Capacity, battery, time and synchronization constraints.
- Priority-aware tardiness penalties in the objective.

## 1) Sets
- N = {0,1,...,n}: node set with depot 0 and customers 1..n.
- V = {1,...,n}: customers.
- T = {1,...,|T|}: trucks.
- D = {1,...,|D|}: drones.
- C = {high, medium, low}: service priority classes.
- A_T = {(i,j,t): i in N, j in N, t in T}: truck arcs.
- A_D = {(i,j,d): i in N, j in N, d in D}: drone arcs.

## 2) Parameters
- Customer demand: q_i.
- Service windows: lb_i, ub_i.
- Priority penalties: p_high, p_medium, p_low.
- Truck params: capacity Q_t, speed v_t, cost per distance c_truck, energy cost e_truck.
- Drone params: capacity Q_d, speed v_d, max battery B_d, costs c_drone and e_drone.
- Fleet constants: swap time S_t, reload time R_t, shift horizon H, big-M M.
- Instance constants: generated coordinates, classes, demands, windows.

## 3) Decision variables
- x_truck[i,j,t] in {0,1}: truck t traverses arc (i,j).
- x_drone[i,j,d] in {0,1}: drone d traverses arc (i,j).
- u_truck[t,i] in {0,1}: truck t serves customer i.
- u_drone[d,i] in {0,1}: drone d serves customer i.
- z1[i,d,t], z2[i,d,t] in {0,1}: synchronization event flags at node i.
- y_loaded[d,i] in {0,1}: loaded flag for drone d on node i.
- w[t,i]: truck remaining load after leaving or arriving at i.
- r[d,i]: drone remaining battery after i.
- a_truck[t,i], l_truck[t,i]: truck arrival/departure at i.
- a_drone[d,i], l_drone[d,i]: drone arrival/departure at i.
- tw_truck[t,i], tw_drone[d,i]: nonnegative waiting helpers.
- a_bar_truck[t,i], a_bar_drone[d,i]: McCormick-like arrival-time helpers.
- T_i: tardiness for customer i.

## 4) Constraints in plain English
- Depot return and route start/end: each used vehicle leaves/returns to depot in one arc count and no self loops.
- Exclusive service: every customer has exactly one of truck service or drone service.
- Vehicle continuity: in-degree equals out-degree for every visited node in each vehicle route.
- Load feasibility: truck load updates with demand and never exceeds truck capacity.
- Battery feasibility: drone battery updates over each arc and stays nonnegative.
- Timing consistency: departure times are arrival + service + sync penalties + waiting; arrivals follow travel times.
- Window and shift constraints: arrivals respect lb/ub via big-M, and all shifts are bounded.
- Subtour handling: MTZ constraints on customer nodes to block disconnected cycles.
- Tardiness linearization: tardiness lower bounded by actual arrival minus ub, inactive when customer not served.
- Priority precedence: high-priority served no later than medium/low where defined.

## 5) Objective
- Minimize total_cost = truck_cost + drone_cost + tardiness_cost.
- truck_cost and drone_cost are based on distance-derived travel time and rates; tardiness_cost uses class penalties and CUST-level tardiness.

## 6) Outputs and validation
- Extractor saves all binaries, arc variables, assignment matrices, timing, load, battery and objective components.
- Strict validator checks:
  - all customers served exactly once,
  - service continuity and depot start/end,
  - truck load and drone battery feasibility,
  - time-window and shift compliance,
  - synchronization consistency,
  - objective component consistency.

## 7) Ambiguity and TODO log
The following are model points where manuscript interpretation differs can exist:
1) exact form of synchronization timing inequalities and whether absolute-time or max-time form is intended.
2) priority precedence meaning (global order vs weighted fairness), implemented conservatively with feasible precedence constraints.
3) loaded drone energy model: code uses load-aware cost and conservative battery depletion rate.
4) subtour prevention method in exact model and whether stronger cuts are expected in the manuscript.
5) handling of service_time during drone route when assigned after reload/launch events.
